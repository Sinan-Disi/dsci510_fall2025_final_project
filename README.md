# Sample Project - Video-Game Analytics & Prediction (RAWG + Steam + VGSales)

This project performs exploratory analysis of modern video-game data (2000–2020) and builds a Ridge-regularized linear regression model to predict Steam’s positive rating ratio.
All figures are generated by src/main.py and saved automatically into the results/ folder (which is Git-ignored).

# Data sources
1) RAWG API-
Fields: name, release year, rating, platforms, genres  
Collected via the RAWG REST API  
Saved to: data/rawg_10000_unfiltered.csv → cleaned as data/rawg_clean.csv

2) Steam Dataset (Kaggle — nikdavis/steam-store-games)-
Fields: positive/negative ratings, price, playtime, owners range, platforms, categories, publisher, release date  
Saved to: data/steam.csv → cleaned as data/steam_clean.csv

3) VGSales (Kaggle — gregorut/videogamesales)-
Fields: platform, year, genre, global sales  
Saved to: data/vgsales.csv → cleaned as data/vgsales_clean.csv

# Data Cleaning & Standardization
Performed inside src/preprocessing.py using parameters from src/config.py:

General Rules:
1) Year filtering: keep only titles from 2000–2020  
2) Remove NSFW keywords and non-game software (utilities, audio production, education, etc.)  
3) Canonical genre mapping  
    All datasets get a normalized genre_std  
    Custom mapping → 12 canonical groups: action, adventure, role-playing, shooter, strategy, simulation, racing, fighting, platform, puzzle, sports, misc  

4) RAWG platform mapping  
    Normalized to 4 buckets: PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch  

5) Steam modeling fields  
    total_ratings = positive_ratings + negative_ratings  
    pos_ratio = positive_ratings / total_ratings  
    owners_mid = midpoint of owner ranges (e.g., "20,000–50,000" → 35000)

All cleaned datasets are used by src/main.py.

# Analysis Results (Q1–Q6)
1) Q1 – RAWG: Most Common Genres  
    Titles are exploded by canonical genre.  
    Top genres include action, adventure, shooter, strategy, simulation.

2) Q2 – RAWG: Average Rating by Platform  
    Rating distribution across PC / PlayStation / Xbox / Switch.  
    PlayStation and Switch tend to score slightly higher on average in this sample.

3) Q3 – Steam: Review Ratio by Price Range  
    Price bins: Free, $0–5, $5–15, $15–30, $30–60  
    Mid-price titles often show the highest positive ratios.

4) Q4 – Steam: Review Volume vs Rating Ratio  
    Buckets: <100, 100–999, 1,000+ total reviews  
    Higher review volume typically aligns with better user perception.

5) Q5 – Steam: Years With the Most Highly Rated Games  
    Using threshold pos_ratio ≥ 0.75 and ≥25 reviews.  
    Peak years appear around 2015–2017.

6) Q6 – (Steam × VGSales): Avg positive_rating_ratio by genre_std vs avg global sales by genre_std; shows a weak or negative correlation.

# Prediction Model (Q7)
A Ridge Linear Regression (L2-regularization) model predicts Steam positive rating ratio using:

Numeric / Engineered Features:
    log_price  
    is_free  
    log_owners_mid  
    log_total_ratings  
    year  
    median_playtime  

Categorical / Embedded Features:
    K-Means genre cluster (5 clusters)  
    Price-bin dummies (price_0_5, price_5_15, ...)

Notes:
    Features are standardized via StandardScaler.  
    GridSearchCV selects optimal alpha.  
    Expected R² remains modest due to the noisy, user-driven nature of Steam reviews.

Outputs include:
    Best alpha  
    Train/validation R²  
    Test R² and RMSE  
    Coefficient importance plot

# Running the project
1) Open src/results.ipynb  
2) Click **Run All** to execute the full workflow:
       Loads cleaned datasets  
       Performs Q1–Q7 analysis  
       Trains the regression model  
       Saves all plots to results/  
       Stores cleaned datasets in data/

3) You do not need to run data_collection.py, preprocessing.py, or main.py unless you want to regenerate raw/cleaned datasets manually.

# Tests
Run tests: python src/tests.py  

# Notes and Limitations
1) Genre mapping collapses many sub-genres into 12 canonical groups.  
2) Steam ratings are user-generated and noisy.  
3) Q7 uses Ridge (regularized linear regression) — expect low R².  
4) All results are descriptive; no causal claims.
